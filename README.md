# AutoMessenger
This program is used to automate messages on social sites.

AutoMessageSender is a Python script that allows you to automate sending messages on your computer. It uses the pyautogui library to simulate typing and sending messages. This can be handy for various purposes, such as sending repetitive messages or testing chat applications.

# Prerequisites
Before you can use AutoMessageSender, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

# Python 3.x
pyautogui library: You can install it using pip with the command pip install pyautogui.
# Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script by executing the following command:

`python auto_message_sender.py
`

Follow the on-screen prompts to configure the message, the number of times to send it, and the delay between messages.

The script will start sending the specified message automatically.

To stop the script, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal or command prompt where the script is running.

# Configuration

message: Enter the message you want to send.

count: Specify the number of times you want to send the message. It should be a positive integer.

delay: Set the delay (in seconds) between sending each message. You can use this to control the rate of message sending. For example, a delay of 0.5 seconds means a half-second pause between each message.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using AutoMessageSender, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and that your system allows the script to access the keyboard and mouse inputs.
